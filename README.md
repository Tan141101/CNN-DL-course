# CNN-DL-course
This is a library showcasing my work while doing the DeepLearning.AI course
This repository is specifically for the ones who have taken the Convolution Neural networks Course offered by DeepLearning.AI
This is just for reference for someone who might need help and should not be completely copied as there will be penalty for the same.
This repositories contains small projects like Image segmentation, application of ResNets, Face recognition program, YOLO algorithm used for autonomous_self_driving_car application and some other useful concepts in the world of Computer-Vision and Convolution-Neural-Networks
